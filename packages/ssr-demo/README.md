# vue-3-basic-sample-app
This example app takes the application from https://github.com/moduslabs/vue3-example-ssr which has 
router and a non singleton vuex and simplifies it to just have a router.

This branch of the repos has SSR rendering added, see the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJfaAkvLXyU&feature=youtu.be
